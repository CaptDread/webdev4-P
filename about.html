                <h2>glazed beginnings</h2>
                <p>Opened on Easter Sunday of 2012 in Key West, FL, Glazed Donuts is the southernmost donut shop in The Continental United States. Serving the most beautiful and creative donuts in all of key west, maybe even florida. At Glazed Donuts we believe that eating should be one of the highlights of your day – every day – and no matter what you choose to eat, it should be made with thought, and care, which is how we work at Glazed Donuts.</p>

                    Each donut is a gustatory work of art, a blank canvas for the Pidgeon’s creativity.

                <h2>the new glazed</h2>
                <p>Sometime in 2019, Jonathan and Megan Pidgeon decided to settle down and pass on the glazed name. In early 2020, they sold Glazed to a family in hope that this family could help build their dream even further. Dave and Cynthia Langley along with their sister Oliva Leyva, took over to run this famous shop. Dave has taken upon himself to advertise and push the Red Buoy name, even going as far as to spend his off days grinding and upselling the many different blends for massive orders all over the island, and beyond. But Red Buoy isn't the biggest sell Glazed is marketing, it's the donuts. Olivia Leyva, a marvel in the kitchen, with decades of bakery experience and an apptitude for making immaculate cake doughnuts. She took to the role as if she was meant for it. At this point the only one who can make the famous doughnuts better than her is Megan Pidgeon herself.</p>

                    Glazed Donuts offers organic coffees, sloshed with scalded milk in café con leche. Try it with the maple bourbon and candied Canadian bacon doughnut — it’s a pairing any true Miamian would approve of.
